In the nineteenth century there was a huge increase in the spread of English because of the development of new technology and new methods of mass production, transportation and communication. 
This spread has accelerated into the tweniteth and twenty-first century. 

Steamships and railways were developed in the first half of the nineteenth century, which brought people into closer contact. 


Railways carried newspapers across countires and in the second half of the nineteenth century, the telephone and telegraph were invented, making it even easier for people to communicate quickly and across vast distances.
